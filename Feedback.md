Great work Tiago!

I really think that the application is coming together really well.

A few points that I wanted to comment on:

1 - It could be a good idea to work on creating a separate file to generalize UI configurations like colors, padding, etc. That can be really useful in the future.

2 - Have you thought about using a different format for the data in your application? Having hardcoded data as you did is feasible during the beginning, but it can get really hard to maintain in the future. Even if you don't want to allow the users to make changes, a persistent solution like core data or another kind of database could be useful for you.

2 - I've left a few comments throughout the code about force casting, and force unwrapping, try to adapt these areas to avoid unintended crashes.

3 - I noticed that the when we scroll down the interface, the color doesn't stay consistent between the title bar and the rest of the UI. Maybe you could try to fix that? Feel free to bring it during our meetings.

4 - I also mentioned a few other points throughout the code.

Again, great work, looking forward to seeing the finished application.
